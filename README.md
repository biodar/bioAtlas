# bioAtlas 

So far, we have been able to translate each value in a ODIM format hdf5 `dataset1/data1/data`'s 360x425 table (total of 153k) into lon/lat pairs from the radar's origin (so far just a 2D plane) thanks to Dr Christopher Hassall.

In this eAtlas repo, the aim is getting [that R code](https://github.com/biodar/bdformats/blob/e77bee40fb6ebf5e76cd9c68691d0c67f3d110fa/Reading%20HDF5%20in%20R.R) into JS using [jsfive](https://github.com/usnistgov/jsfive).

## Note
This is a template repository to use the Turing Geo-visualization Engine (TGVE or eAtlas) in a React app and deploying it in github pages.
